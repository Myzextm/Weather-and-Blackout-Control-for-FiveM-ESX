# Weather-and-Blackout-Control-for-FiveM-ESX
The Weather and Blackout Script for ESX lets admins control the weather, time of day, and toggle a blackout effect. Admins can use the /weather command to change weather and time, and /blackout to simulate a power outage. Both commands are restricted to admins for server customization.
